abstract: Public transportation brings numerous benefits to communities when it provides people with mobility and access to opportunities. A well-designed and widely utilized system is required for regions to gain access to these benefits. Transit policies must be efficient, relevant to their specific region, and take into consideration how residents utilize public transit. In this paper, we focus on the implications of bus stop balancing and route schedule design for the Madison Metropolitan Transit in Madison, Wisconsin. We discuss where populations live and work to illustrate potential servicing barriers that limit access to employment centers. We recommend adopting standardized spacing between stops of 1000-2500 feet to increase transit speed and reliability with a particular focus on areas with low car ownership. Finally, we spotlight how transit services can be expanded to include non-traditional commuters. The adoption of these suggested improvements will lead to faster transit times with improved reliability and more equitable service within the Greater Madison Area.

abstract: Transcriptional regulatory networks control context-specific gene expression patterns and play important roles in normal and disease processes. Advances in genomics are rapidly increasing our ability to measure different components of the regulation machinery at the single-cell and bulk population level. An important challenge is to combine different types of regulatory genomic measurements to construct a more complete picture of gene regulatory networks across different disease, environmental, and developmental contexts. In this review, we focus on recent computational methods that integrate regulatory genomic datasets to infer context specificity and dynamics in regulatory networks.
