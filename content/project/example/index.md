I am Editor-in-Chief of *Genomics: Insights*, a new NHGRI-supported digital venue for students and postdocs to communicate cutting-edge genomics research to a general audience. Our main goals are to increase public engagement with genomics research and serve as a learning experience for early-career researchers to communicate science. Science communication is a skill often overlooked in many undergrate and graduate programs. 

As Editor-in-Chief, I coordinated getting the very first *Genomics: Insights* articles published online and I continue to coordinate the publications today. I lead the editorial board, which reviews the submissions and offers helpful critiques to improve the accessibility of the article. I also work on recruiting new editorial board members and also lead workshops related to writing accessible and interesting science articles. Recently, I helped coordinate a more streamlined submission process for both submitters and the editorial board.
