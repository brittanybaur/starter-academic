I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Wisconsin - Madison in the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery. I am currently researching the role of 3D genome organization in gene regulation, evolution and disease. For the past two years, I have served as Editor-in-Chief of *Genomics: Insights*, a collaboration between the NHGRI and Smithsonian. *Genomics: Insights* is a digital venue for trainees to submit short communication pieces on cutting edge genomics research to a general audience. I am also interested in data-driven science policy and I am currently Communications Chair for Catalysts for Science Policy (CaSP) at UW-Madison.
